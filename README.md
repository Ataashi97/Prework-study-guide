# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
I did this project to acheive a deeper understanding of code and as someone who has no experience with code I feel like I actually learned something. I was motivated to finish this project becasue I want to change my career path into something that I can take anywhere in the world. I solved several problems one of which was and error in my code that I couldn't figure out what was wrong but I took a deep breath and a stap back to analyze it and realized i had written the code wrong and had to re-write it. I learned that you have to read everything with coding and if you get something wrong you have to find a new angle to fix it if need be.
